# chibiTxt
A simple file compressor using Rust.

# What is it?
Compresses files by using [Huffman encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

# What file types?
Right now only txt. However, the code is simple enough to use with pretty much any file type, just requires a little bit of fine-tuning. The idea is to show how to write a simple encoding/decoding program.
